## Testing Philosophy & Strategy

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with a comprehensive multi-environment testing strategy designed for Cloudflare Workers deployment.

### Core Principles

1. **Test First**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Environment Parity**: Tests run in environments that match deployment targets
3. **Fail Fast**: Catch issues early in the development pipeline
4. **Real-world Validation**: Post-deployment tests against actual deployed services

npm run test:metrics:production      # Production metrics validation
```

## TDD Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Write Failing Tests (RED)

1. **Identify the feature** to implement
2. **Write test cases** that describe the expected behavior
3. **Run tests** - they should fail initially
4. **Commit the failing tests** to establish the contract

```bash
# Example: Adding new endpoint
npm run test:unit                    # Should fail for new endpoint
```

### Phase 2: Implement Minimal Code (GREEN)

1. **Write minimal code** to make tests pass
2. **Focus on functionality**, not optimization
3. **Run tests frequently** to get immediate feedback

```bash
# Implement the feature
npm run test:unit                    # Should pass now
npm run test:integration             # Broader validation
```

### Phase 3: Refactor & Optimize (REFACTOR)

1. **Improve code quality** without changing behavior
2. **Add error handling** and edge cases
3. **Optimize performance** if needed
4. **Ensure tests still pass**

```bash
# After refactoring
npm run test:unit                    # Should still pass
npm run test:integration             # Should still pass
npm run test:performance             # Check performance impact
```

### Phase 4: Integration Testing

1. **Test cross-component interactions**
2. **Validate database operations**
3. **Test queue processing**

```bash
npm run test:integration             # Cross-component testing
npm run test:queue                   # Queue processing
npm run test:email-verification:full # Complete workflows
```

## Deployment Testing Pipeline

### Pre-deployment Tests (Local Environment)

The deploy script runs these tests before deployment:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Unit tests (fast feedback)
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests (component interaction)
npm run test:integration
```

**Purpose**: Validate code quality and functionality before deployment.

### Post-deployment Tests (Target Environment)

After successful deployment, environment-specific tests run:

#### Staging Deployment
```bash
npm run test:staging:workers
```
- Tests against deployed staging API
- Validates real infrastructure
- Uses staging database and configuration
- Includes email verification workflows

#### Production Deployment
```bash
npm run test:smoke:production
```
- Minimal critical path testing
- Validates production health
- Quick feedback on deployment success
- Automatic cleanup of test data

## Test Data Management

### Email Address Patterns

| Environment | Pattern | Example | Email Sent? |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Local | `@example.com` | `test@example.com` | No (mocked) |
| Staging | `test+staging-smoke-test@rnwolf.net` | `test+staging-smoke-test-123-abc@rnwolf.net` | No (filtered) |
| Production | `test+smoke-test@rnwolf.net` | `test+smoke-test-456-def@rnwolf.net` | No (filtered) |

### Email Filtering

The email verification worker automatically filters test emails:

```typescript
const testEmailDomains = [
  '@example.com',
  '@example.org', 
  '@example.net',
  '@test.com',
  '@test.example.com',
  '@performance-test.example.com',
  '@smoke-test.example.com'
];

// Also check for plus addressing test patterns (test+something@domain)
const isTestEmailDomain = testEmailDomains.some(domain => email.endsWith(domain));
const isTestEmailPlusAddressing = email.includes('+smoke-test') || email.includes('+staging-smoke-test') || email.startsWith('test+');

const isTestEmail = isTestEmailDomain || isTestEmailPlusAddressing;
```

### Database State Management

- **Local**: Fresh database for each test run
- **Staging**: Persistent database, tests use unique identifiers
- **Production**: Minimal test data, automatic cleanup

### Test Data Cleanup

```bash
# Automatic cleanup after deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh staging          # Includes automatic cleanup
./scripts/deploy.sh production       # Includes automatic cleanup

# Manual cleanup if needed
npm run cleanup:staging
npm run cleanup:production
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### 1. Environment Detection Problems

**Symptom**: Tests show wrong environment (e.g., "local" when expecting "staging")

**Solution**: Check vitest configuration and environment variables
```bash
# Verify environment detection
console.log('env.ENVIRONMENT:', env.ENVIRONMENT);
console.log('config.corsOrigin:', config.corsOrigin);
```

#### 2. CORS Errors in Tests

**Symptom**: `expected 'https://www.rnwolf.net' to be 'http://localhost:3000'`

**Cause**: Test running in wrong environment

**Solution**: Ensure correct vitest config is used
```bash
# Check which config is being used
npm run test:staging:workers         # Should use vitest.config.staging.ts
```

#### 3. Database Connection Issues

**Symptom**: Database queries fail in tests

**Local**: Check D1 binding in vitest config
**Staging/Production**: Verify database ID and environment

#### 4. Email Verification Issues

**Symptom**: Undelivered mail bounce messages

**Cause**: Real emails being sent to test domains

**Solution**: Verify email filtering is working
```bash
# Check email worker logs for filtering messages
# Should see: [TEST_EMAIL_SKIP] messages
```

#### 5. Queue Processing Failures

**Symptom**: Queue tests fail or timeout

**Local**: Check queue mocking in test setup
**Remote**: Verify queue configuration in wrangler.jsonc

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check test environment configuration
npm run test:staging:workers -- --reporter=verbose

# Validate metrics endpoints
npm run test:metrics:staging

# Check database state
npm run db:subscribers:staging

# Verify deployment health
npm run test:health:staging
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Run performance tests to identify bottlenecks
npm run test:performance:staging

# Check metrics for response times
npm run metrics:staging

# Validate concurrent request handling
npm run test:load
```

## Best Practices

### Test Writing

1. **Write descriptive test names** that explain the expected behavior
2. **Use the AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Test both success and failure scenarios**
4. **Keep tests independent** and idempotent
5. **Use appropriate test data** for each environment

### Environment Management

1. **Use environment-specific configurations** consistently
2. **Never send real emails** from test environments
3. **Clean up test data** after test runs
4. **Monitor test performance** and optimize slow tests

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Run full test suite** before deployment
2. **Validate deployment** with post-deployment tests
3. **Monitor production health** with smoke tests
4. **Have rollback procedures** ready for failures

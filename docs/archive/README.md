# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation that was created during the development process but is no longer current or relevant to the working system.

## Archived Documents

### TDD Implementation Guides (Interim)
- `newsletter_subscription_tdd.md` - Early TDD approach for subscription worker
- `tdd_implementation_guide_Email_Verification_Phase_1.md` - Phase 1 email verification implementation guide
- `unsubscribe_worker_tdd.md` - Early TDD approach for unsubscribe worker

**Why Archived**: These documents described interim TDD approaches that were used during development but don't reflect the final implementation. The actual TDD process and current testing approach is documented in `../testing-guide.md`.

### Implementation Notes (Completed)
- `email-verification-implementation.md` - Implementation notes for email verification
- `cleanup-smoke-tests.md` - Operational notes for test cleanup

**Why Archived**: These were working notes and implementation details that are now incorporated into the final system and documented elsewhere.

### Analysis Reports (Historical)
- `test-analysis-report.md` - Analysis of testing approach and results

**Why Archived**: This was an interim analysis document created during development. The current testing strategy is documented in `../testing-guide.md`.

## Current Documentation

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when they:
1. Describe interim approaches that were superseded
2. Contain implementation details that are now part of the working system
3. Were created as stepping stones during development
4. Are no longer needed for understanding or maintaining the current system

Archived documents are kept for historical reference and to understand the development process.
